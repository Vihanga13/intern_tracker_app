**Form Validation Testing**:
- Try invalid emails, short passwords, mismatched confirmations
- Test phone number formats and special characters in names
- Verify all required field validations work correctly

## Security Notes

- All password fields use secure input (hidden text)
- Email validation includes format and basic domain checking  
- Password requirements enforce strong security practices

## File Structure

```
lib/Pages/
├── login_screen.dart           # Main login interface
